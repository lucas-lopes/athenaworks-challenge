## Overview

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate if you have the core skills required to join the ATHENAWORKSâ€™ Development Team. Please read carefully the instructions and follow them to give a solution for the problem. Resolution time matters. So please try to find a solution as soon as possible and email us the results.

## Description

Given this string:


aoNHQATeMNLuWC4vMdGgQpqMge7bit

1. Write some code (pick your favorite language) that builds a sorted array based on number of times that character exists.

2. Return the character and the count.

3. Bonus points:
   Describe your testing process to validate you have the correct answer.

## The Challenge Solution

This repository can be cloned to run the code locally. Basically, I used Java 11 to solve this challenge.

[THE CODE SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND IN THIS LINK](/src/solution/Solution.java)

I will leave the code solution below as well:

```java
package solution;

import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Solution {

    public static Map<String, Integer> buildSortedArrayByString(String word) {
        Map<String, Integer> lettersSorted = new TreeMap<>();
        var wordSplit = word.split("");

        // Insert the letter into the collection and count the repetitions
        Stream.of(wordSplit).forEach(letter -> {
            if (lettersSorted.containsKey(letter)) {
                lettersSorted.put(letter, lettersSorted.get(letter) + 1);
            } else {
                lettersSorted.put(letter, 1);
            }
        });

        // Sort the collection by value, following the DESC order
        return lettersSorted.entrySet()
            .stream()
            .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder()))
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                Map.Entry::getKey,
                Map.Entry::getValue,
                (e1, e2) -> e1, LinkedHashMap::new
            ));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var test1 = buildSortedArrayByString("aoNHQATeMNLuWC4vMdGgQpqMge7bit");
        var test2 = buildSortedArrayByString("IhavebeenworkingwithDevOpstoolslikeKubernetesJenkinsTravisRancherDocker");
        var test3 = buildSortedArrayByString("IwouldliketoworkatAthenaWorks");

        System.out.println(test1);
        System.out.println(test2);
        System.out.println(test3);
    }

}
```

### Explaining...

This String example `IwouldliketoworkatAthenaWorks` will produce the following return:

```
{
    o = 4, 
    k = 3, 
    t = 3, 
    a = 2, 
    e = 2, 
    l = 2, 
    r = 2, 
    w = 2, 
    A = 1, 
    I = 1, 
    W = 1, 
    d = 1, 
    h = 1, 
    i = 1, 
    n = 1, 
    s = 1, 
    u = 1
}
```

Basically, the letter "o" is repeated 4 times in this example. It's the letter that is repeated more times. 

The letters "k" and "t" are repeated 3 times each one, so to sort strategy used in this case was the normal order or specifically the alphabetic order by key.

In Java, the TreeMap data structure has this behavior: sort the elements by key following the normal order, or how explained above, using the alphabetic order.

Below the strategy/logic used is better explained.

## Solution

The first thing was to understand which data structure use to return a key with the letter, and the value with the count of times that the letter repeated in the string.

I decided to use Map with a String as the key, and an Integer as the value. Use an instance of TreeMap was chosen because by default the elements inserted are automatically sorted using the normal order.

The complete logic was divided into two parts:

```
1. Get input and build a Map<String, Integer> collection using the following logic:
    1.1 Each new letter is a new key.
    1.2 The total that this key repeated is set to the value. 
   
2. When we have a Map<String, Integer> is need to do a sort by value from bigger to lower.
```

Basically, the collection that is returned to the end is:

```
1. Letters that repeated more using the order decreasing.

2. If exist two or more letters that repeated the same number of times, the order is decided by key using the natural order.
```
